<h1> React Tic Tac Toe </h1>

Tutorial followed on reactjs.org to help teach me the basics of React. 
I will continue to add functionality alongside improving the design to help e further understand the concepts and best practices of React.

<h2> Current Functionality </h2>

1. Turn based.
2. Picks a winner.
3. Allows users to step through previous steps.

<h2>ToDo</h2>

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.

2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.

3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.

4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.

5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.

6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

7. Add a versus computer option.
